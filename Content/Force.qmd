Force (matter movement, matter acceleration, mattertransport)

Hypothesis: Accelerated mass causes force (analogous to "radiation"). Mass is supposed to originate from Higgs Field.

Force:
$$\begin{split} &
F = 
\frac{d}{dt}p = 
\frac{1}{c} \frac{d}{dt}(E_{kin}) = 
m \cdot a
\end{split}$${#eq-force}
