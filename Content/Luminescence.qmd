Luminescence:
<!-- \footnote{"cold light"} \index{Luminescence} \index{Optical Radiation} -->

Producing optical radiation with exitaction of atoms and melecules thorough transitions into ground state (emission of photons):

- Electroluminescence: electrical exitation with diods or gas discharge 
- Photoluminescence: exitation with electromagnetic radiation (photons), phosphor or fluor 
- Chemoluminescence: exitation with chemical reaction, e.g. luminol 
- Bioluminescence: exitation with chemical reaction at living organs, e.g. oxidation of luciferin 
- Triboluminescence: exitation with friction or tearing apart (e.g. sugar cristals) 
- Radioluminescence: exitation with irradiation with $\alpha-$, $\beta-$ or $\gamma$-radiation
