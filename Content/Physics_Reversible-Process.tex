The Entropy "S" is a measure for disorder of a system (refering to the amount of micro states, that a system might achieve): 
$
S = k \ln(\Omega)
$
\cite{pfeiler_experimentalphysik_Ed1_V2}

where k = Boltzman constant, and $\Omega$ = microcanonical total amount of states of the different equivalent micro states

\

Reversible processes leave the "order" of state unchanged; they do not progress spontaneously: For reversible processes, the Entropy S remains constant, $\Delta S = 0$. Irreversible process diminish the "order" of state; they do progress spontaneously: For irreversible change of states, the Entropy diminshes, $\Delta S < 0$. \cite{pfeiler_experimentalphysik_Ed1_V2}
