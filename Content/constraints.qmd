Constraints:

- initial state, starting conditions
- acting boundary conditions (to move within): e.g. demography, economical and political stability, labor force, education and know-how, health and technological level
- access to limited resources: e.g. chemical elements, minerals, fuels, commodities, trade and transportations, etc.
- contractual agreements and covenants, legal assurance
- juristic law framework



Modelling movement (change of state) under constraints:

1. Movement ist charecterized by change of energy, Lagrangian $\mathcal{L} \neq 0$:
$$\begin{split} &
\mathcal{L} = \mathcal{K} - \mathcal{U}
\qquad
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial r} = F
\qquad
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial v} = p
\end{split}$${#eq-lagrangian}

2. Movement happens within constraints of forces. Constrains are observable, whereas forces might be unknown. Therefore, $r$ can be determined from $\mathcal{L}$ (Energy and Work) of the **system at rest $F=0$**, instead than from "searching" all acting forces $F_i$. In general, unknow forces at motion are defined by solving the Eigenvalueproblem. Solving for **$\mathcal{L}$** at equilibirium:
$$\begin{split} &
F_{total} = \hat{F_i} + \tilde{F_i} = \hat{F_i} + \sum_{k=1}^{s_d} \lambda_k a_{ki} = \frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial v_i} \right) - \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial r_i} 
= \begin{cases}
    = 0    : \text{ Equilibrium} \\
    \neq 0 : \text{ Movement}
  \end{cases}
\end{split}$${#eq-constrainforce}

    and at same time solving for constraining conditions that hold the system at rest (equilibrium):
$$\begin{split} &
\sum_{l=1}^f a_{kl} v_l + b_k = 0
\end{split}$${#eq-constraincondition}

3. Rest is characterized by unchanged energy, Hamiltonian $\mathcal{H} = E_{kin} + E_{pot} = const.$. There is movement from state of rest if the new $\mathcal{H} \neq 0$ differs from the initial one. Using the found solution for the Lagrangian $\mathcal{L}$ containing the constraints, the Hamiltonian for the energy is deduced:
$$\begin{split} &
\mathcal{H} = \sum_i p_i v_i - \mathcal{L} = pv - \mathcal{L}  = Fr - \mathcal{L} = W - \mathcal{L}  = (\Delta E - \Delta H) - \mathcal{L}
\end{split}$${#eq-hamiltonian}

4. Change of state/position is characterized by movement. Eventually, by solving the new system of differential equations, from the found solution of the energy $\mathcal{H}$, the set ${r,v,p}$ which describe the movement (and thus the change of state), is deduced:
$$\begin{split} &
\dot r_i = v_i = \frac{\partial\mathcal{H}}{\partial p_i}   \qquad
\dot p_i = F_i = - \frac{\partial\mathcal{H}}{\partial r_i}
\end{split}$${#eq-movement}
