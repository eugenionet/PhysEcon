Society's living requires:

- "Resources" are processed to create goods to be consumed
- "Labor" is used to process goods and services
- "Capital" intermediates value between goods and services

Society organizes in groups of households:

- natural households
- juristic corporations
- governmental institutions

Households cooperate though exchange (trade) of goods and services between "Demand" and "Supply" using monetary valuation:

- Goods Market Production, Inventory, Trade $\rightarrow$ "Price" for value of production
- Labor Market Employment, Demographic Structure, Work Capabilities $\rightarrow$ "Wage" for value of labor
- Capital Market Savings, Investments, Exchange $\rightarrow$ "Interest" for value of capital

Supply is provided by the income $Y$:

$$\begin{split} &
Y = L  + Y_H + Y_A + T_A + Y_G - Z_G
\end{split}$${#eq-ecoincome}

$$\begin{split} &
Y = C + S + T + M - X
\end{split}$${#eq-gdpsupply}


Demand is satisfied by the production $V_I$:

$$\begin{split} &
V_I = C + I + G + X - M
\end{split}$${#eq-gdpdemand}


Equilibrium:

$$\begin{split} &
Y = V_I       \\&
L - C = S = I        \\&
C + S = L        \\&
C + I = R
\end{split}$${#eq-ecoequi}


Domestic Production & International Trade:

$$\begin{split} &
V_S = Y + T - G_A + D_A
\end{split}$${#eq-gdp}

$$\begin{split} &
V_N = V_S - D_A
\end{split}$${#eq-nnp}

$$\begin{split} &
V_I = V_S - R_M + R_X
\end{split}$${#eq-gdp}



Monetary Value of Production:

$$\begin{split} &
P \cdot V_I = Q \cdot N
\end{split}$${#eq-moneyquant}

Macro Productivity:
$$\begin{split} &
Productivity = \frac{Output}{Input} = \frac{V_I}{Y}
\end{split}$${#eq-productivity}

We track production at microeconomic level through (acronyms see @sec-acroeconom):

$A =$ Assets represent "Property Capital" which consist of "Current Capital" and "Structural Capital". Those investments are required for the production processes.

$B =$ Liabilities represent "Financial Capital" which consist of "Exogen Funds" and "Endogen Funds". Later includes "Equity Capital" and "Retained Gains". Those funds do finance Assets.

$W =$ Expenses represent "Work Efforts" to "Supply Production" with use of Assets.

$Y =$ Income represents "Received Earnings" achieved with production to "Satisfy Demand". Parts of the gains will be retained to finance Assets.

$R =$ Gain, Profit or Loss from executed work (resultant value from input efforts) is represented by $R = Y - W$

The "transfer of energy" between all subsystems is mapped in balancing out theirs capital (usage of capital for production though possessed assets): $A = B + R$

Micro Productivity:
$$\begin{split} &
Productivity = \frac{Output}{Input} = \frac{Y}{W}
\end{split}$${#eq-microprod}
