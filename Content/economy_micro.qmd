How individuals and companies make decisions to allocate scarce resources.

Assets = Property Capital (substance of matter, object movement/change) \
Liabilities = Financial Capital (space of movement, maneuverability) \
Expenses = Costa of Work through labor force and machines \
Income = Earnings from sales of goods & services \

$f_A(Assets) = f_L(Liabilities)$ = "momentum" $p$ from initial state $r_0$ to new state $r_1$, and "state change" = $r = r_1 - r_0$
