How consistently map economic measures to the quantities of nature to model the economical system?

Input:
$$\begin{split} &
Input = f_0(Resouces, Labor, Capital) \text{ = Work = } \Delta\text{Energy} = p \cdot v
\end{split}$${#eq-ecoinput}


Output:
$$\begin{split} &
Output \text{ = Goods + Services = Production = } \Delta\text{State} = V_I 
\end{split}$${#eq-ecooutput}


Productivity:
$$\begin{split} &
Productivity = \frac{Output}{Input} = \frac{\Delta State}{\Delta Energy} = \frac{Production}{Work} = \frac{V_I}{pv}
\end{split}$${#eq-ecooutput}

As a first approach, considering the geometrical perspective of the concept of "work" (@eq-workgeom), applied to economical measurements, so to satisfy the following system:

$f_A(Assets) = f_B(Liabilities + Gain)$ = "momentum" $p$ from initial state $r_0$ to new state $r_1$, where the change of state is $r = r_1 - r_0$

Matter substance, object movement/change: 
$$\begin{split} &
A = f_A = F \cdot t = p
\end{split}$${#eq-physassets}

Space of movement, maneuverability: 
$$\begin{split} &
B + R = f_B = m \cdot v = p
\end{split}$${#eq-physliabilities}

Work input (efforts, costs) through labor force, machines and infrastructure applied, and materials consumed for production: 
$$\begin{split} &
W = f_0 = F \cdot r = m \cdot \frac{v}{t} \cdot r = p \cdot v
\end{split}$${#eq-physexpens}

Energy transfer, energy change, profit or loss: 
$$\begin{split} &
Y = \Delta E = \frac{1}{2} pv + \mathcal{U}
\end{split}$${#eq-phyincome}

Production value inflation adjusted:
$$\begin{split} &
P \cdot V_I = \sum Y_{adjust} = \sum (W + R)_{adjust} = \Delta U - \Delta H = Q \cdot N
\end{split}$${#eq-physprod}

see @eq-workthemostat and @eq-workgeom

Thus, to be determined are $v$ (economy velocity) and $p$ (financial structure). Eventually, determine $r$ = "state change through trajectory" (substance change to the new assets structure) by given $v$ = "velocity of movement" (Business speed = monetary value, price with inflation), or determine $v$ by given $r$. The individual positions $\{ i,j,l,m \}$ of Liabilities $\{ B_i + R_j \}_k$, Assets $\{ A_m \}_k$, and Expenses $\{ W_l \}_k$ shall be grouped in sets $\{ k \}$, so to satisfy $f_k(i,j) = f_k(m) = f_k(l) = \{ pv \}_k$.

The constraints shall be modelled with the Lagrangian. Hence, "Work" shall be derived from the Hamiltonian which leads to the identification of the "movement" (= change, transformation) of the trajectory (= path to new state) with $\dot r = v$ and $\dot p = F$.

Experiment design: **$p$ and $v$ are modelled ex-ante with means of CONSTRAINTS from contractual agreement and from given juristic legislation, in such a way that physics laws are satisfied. Decisions making occure within this ex-ante frame.**
